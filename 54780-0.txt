ACT I.


    _SCENE._—_A large hall in_ SANTA CLAUS’
             _Snow-palace. Throne-chair_ R. U. E.;
             _table and chair_ L.; _bell cord_ L.;
             _as curtain rises_ GUSSIE _is discovered
              at table_ L., _writing in a large book_.

_Enter_, SNOW-FAIRIES, C., _and come down to front_.

                         SONG OF SNOW-FAIRIES.
   _To the tune of “My Boyhood’s Happy Home Down on the Farm.”_

                 We are fairies of the snow,
                 And every where we go
                 We make the hearts of children glad and gay;
                 From their window seats so warm,
                 They look out upon the storm
                 And dream of future childish sports and play.

       _Chorus._ We fulfill a mission too,
                 As every one should do;
                 Who have a mission worthy of the name,
                 From our home in Northern clime,
                 Come we forth at Christmas time
                 A quiet share in Christmas joys to claim.

                 On earth’s cold and frozen face
                 Each white snow-flake takes its place,
                 All unite a cosy mantle thus to form,
                 Universal mother keep,
                 Covered during winter’s sleep
                 ’Till spring-time’s sun shines forth again so warm.

_At close of song_ GUSSIE _comes down to front, makes an extravagant bow
to the_ FAIRIES.

_Gus._ Well now, that’s clevah, deucedly clevah doncherno, but ladies,
you distract my mind from the duties incident to my exalted office. I
must really ask you to depaht. I must indeed.

_Fai._ (FAIRIES _stamp their feet indignantly and speak in chorus_)
Listen to that! The horrid man! Distract his mind indeed, bah! (_to_
GUSSIE) You never had a mind.

_Gus._ Beg pardon ladies, but it is twue, evewy word twue. This is
Chwistmas Eve and in one hour fwom this time I must have the “World’s
Directory of Deserving Didlets” weady for Santa Claus before he starts
out upon his annual journey.

_Fai._ (_in chorus_) Is that true? Why did you not say so before?

_Queen._ (FAIRIES _go to entrances_ R. _and_ L., QUEEN _goes to_ C.
_All turn and look at_ GUSSIE _as_ QUEEN _says_) Gussie, we go, but we
return; and when we do return we will sing—Comrades!!

                                                 (_exeunt_, FAIRIES

_Gus._ Well, I flatter myself, that was nicely done. Other fellows may
have some trouble in managing the ladies, but it is no trouble at all,
when you know how. Gussie old boy, you are clevah, deucedly clevah.

                        _Enter_, SANTA CLAUS, C.

_Santa._ Well my good fellow, are all things prepared? Is the Directory
ready for my journey to-night?

_Gus._ (_making profound bow_) Yes, your majesty, it will be ready in
fifteen minutes.

                                      (_sits at table_, L., _and writes_

_Santa._ By-the-way, Gus—

_Gus._ (_interrupting_) Gussie, sir, Gussie.

_Santa._ Well, Gussie, how are the children panning out this year? Are
there as many as usual?

_Gus._ More, your majesty, many more.

_Santa._ More? Well, well! And the Smiths, I suppose there are a few
Smiths left?

_Gus._ Ah! your majesty, their name is Legion!

_Santa._ Legion! Eh? Um, ah! yes, Legion. Well, it may rest us a
little to have them change their name. What is it Shakespeare has to
say on the subject of changing names? Smith—Smith—by any other name
would—um—no! no! that is not exactly what I want.

       (_walks up and down stage, hands behind his back, meditatively_

_Gus._ Oh! I say, your majesty, have you heard of the accident?

_Santa._ Accident? Whose accident?

_Gus._ The Jones’, sir.

_Santa._ The Jones’? And what is the matter with the Jones’?

_Gus._ (_sorrowfully_) Dead!

_Santa._ What, dead? All dead?

_Gus._ Oh no! your majesty, not all of them, but Johnny and his sister
Sue—

_Santa._ (_starting towards_ GUSSIE _angrily_) Villain, I fain would
smite thee! (_stops suddenly and draws hand across forehead_) No! no!
what would I do? Destroy the last lingering specimen of an almost
extinct race? I will spare thee, dude. Proceed with thy labors. (SANTA
_walks up and down stage thoughtfully, while_ GUSSIE _makes a great
show of writing in his book_. SANTA _stops to watch him as he writes
all the way across one page and as far to one side as he can reach_)
What are you doing there?

_Gus._ Your majesty, I am writing the name of the child of a Russian
exile, but I fear you will have to carry a few K’s and Z’s loose in
your pocket, for of a verity the book will not contain them all. (_gong
heard striking off_ L., SANTA _listens_, GUSSIE _starts_) Great smoke,
I am discovered! There goes that chestnut bell!

_Santa._ It is the ninth hour; I must hasten. (_to_ GUSSIE) Summon my
household that I may bid them good-by. (GUSSIE _pulls bell-rope_, L.,
_great noise of tin pans, cans, cat calls, etc., heard_) There, there,
that will do. We do not want to perform the miracle of raising the dead.

FAIRIES _rush in_ R., HOLIDAYS L., MRS. CLAUS C., _followed by_ KITTY

_Mrs. C._ Wh-wh-where’s the fire!

_Omnes._ Yes, where’s the fire.

_Santa._ The fire? There is no fire my dears.

_Mrs. C._ (_seizing_ SANTA’S _sleeve and trying to lead him off_ L.)
Then let us get out of this house at once, hubby, there is going to be
an earth-quake! Didn’t you hear that noise?

_Gus._ Oh! pshaw, that was only a fall in the temperature.

_Omnes._ Is that so? Oh! I am so glad.

_Santa._ Yes, but I don’t want you to be glad. It is very disrespectful
in you, to say the least, to be glad at a time like this.

_Mrs. C._ Why my dear hubby, what is the matter with the time?

_Santa._ The matter is, my dear, that I am going to leave you presently.

_Omnes._ Going to leave us?

_Kitty._ Going to leave us? Why papa, you will be too early for the
World’s Fair.

_Santa._ I am not going to the World’s Fair, daughter. Have you
forgotten that this is Christmas Eve, my regular night out?

_Mrs. C._ Why, so it is; I had forgotten. To-night you go forth
to distribute gum-drops, drums and dollies to the children of all
Christendom. It is very kind of you my dear, I am sure, and I am sorry
that you are compelled to tear yourself away, but you will return
to-morrow?

_Santa._ I am glad that you appreciate me, my dear. Let me advise you
to keep a good thing while you have it.

_Kitty._ Yes, papa is a good man; at least, I suppose he is a good man.
Good is a relative term, and men are so scarce in this kingdom of the
North Pole, that I cannot judge by comparison.

_Santa._ Daughter, I am an exceptional creature in every way. Thank the
Fates that you have never been permitted to meet a less worthy specimen
of the race than your papa.

_Gus._ (GUSSIE _giggles_) Speaking of men, how about me?

                           (_swaggers with thumbs in arm holes of vest_

_Omnes._ Oh! you don’t count; you’re a dude.

                                          (GUSSIE _retires discomfited_

_Kitty._ Papa, are men as scarce in the land of mortals as they are
here?

_Santa._ No, my child, no indeed; there are not enough to go around
to be sure; and under the present system, old maids seem to be a
compulsory blessing; still they are numerous, quite so.

_Kitty._ (_rapturously_) Oh! papa, let’s move!

_Mrs. C._ Why, what is the matter with the child? (_goes over to_
KITTY) My dear you must be ill: come, take a milk-shake and go to bed.

_Gus._ (_aside_) Milk-shake! I believe I am feeling a kind of goneness
too.

_Santa._ No! no, there is nothing the matter with the child, only a
little natural curiosity, that is all; but Kitty you would better
remain content to know no man but your papa; he is an exceptional
creature, I assure you.

_Omnes._ Yes, your papa is a model man.

_Santa Claus sings_

                       A MODEL MAN.

     It is, my friends, quite difficulty to find a fault in me,
     I have in some queer way escaped total depravity.
     Though in unbroken line I trace descent from mother Eve,
     There is no sin in my make-up; I’m perfect, I believe.

  _Chorus._
     He is a perfect paragon, old Santa Claus.
     He never swears above his breath—unless he has a cause;
     Enumerate his virtues I think we hardly can,
     But taken all in all he is a perfect Model Man.

     Our brightest plans in this vain world are apt to go amiss,
     But keep your temper; don’t destroy your hopes of future bliss;
     Don’t scold your wife, don’t kick your dog, let me your model be;
     I scold my wife? Not for my life! She’d surely wallop me.

  Another thing:—Avoid conceit; quit blowing your own horn,
     But be like me, as modest as the blush of early morn,
     And when we’ve reached the end of life, with pride we look back
     Upon the wide swath we have cut, a broad and shining track.

_Gus._ Well now that’s clevah, deucedly clevah, by Jove. Methinks I’ll
warble a little myself.

                                                   (_starts down stage_

_Omnes._ Oh! spare us, spare us!

                                 (_stopping him_

_Gus._ Just as you please ladies, but it is your misfortune that you do
not appreciate good music.

_Kitty._ Papa, that is a very pretty custom of yours, of every year
giving presents to the children of mortals; so pretty indeed, that I
wonder you have not tried it at home, that you have never given your
daughter a Christmas present.

_Santa._ My dear child, it would be useless; the wealth of my kingdom
is at your command; your every wish is gratified. What more could I
give you than you already have?

_Kitty._ But surely, surely, there is something in the land of mortals
which I have not. Could you not bring me a gift from there?

_Santa._ I had not thought of that. Yes, ask what e’er thou wilt, be it
in my power to do so I will grant it.

_Kitty._ You have given your word.

_Santa._ Yes, and my word is worth twenty piastries on the dollar.

_Kitty._ Then papa, bring me—bring me—a man!

_Mrs. C._ What is the child saying?

_Omnes._ She says she wants a man!

_Santa._ (_aside_) Caught out on a foul! How am I to get out of this
predicament? I have given my word and I would rather break a dollar
bill than break my word. (_thinks_) Ah, I have it! I will bring her a
man, but oh, such a man! I will bring her a boodler, a fee-grabber, a
Farmer’s Alliance advocate, ha! ha! ha! She will be disgusted with the
whole race and I will save my honor and my child. (_turns to_ KITTY.)
Daughter, you shall have your man.

      _During this speech all indulge in business of surprise at_
                        KITTY’S _rash request_.

_Kitty._ Papa, you are a gem!

_Santa._ A gem, daughter? You mean a jewel do you not?

_Gus._ No she means tin-types; three for a quarter, doncherno.
(_sleigh-bells heard off_ R., GUSSIE _in horror_) Great smoke! There
goes that chestnut bell again.

_Santa._ Ah! my sleigh and my fleet-footed reindeers are ready. I must
away.

                  _Enter_, FOOTMAN _and_ COACHMAN, C.,
               _and stand one on each side of entrance_.

_Footman._ Your majesty, we are ready.
                                                            (_bows low_

_Santa._ And so am I. My friends you well might envy me my ride
to-night, with the pale moon shining overhead and the white snow
gleaming beneath the feet of my fleet-footed reindeers. And the bells,
what melody their little metal tongues peal forth upon the frosty air.
Surely it is a subject worthy the pen of a poet; the description of a
sleigh-ride on a night like this.

_Santa Claus sings_

                               SLEIGHING SONG.
                _To the tune of “The Village Blacksmith.”_

                Cling, cling, cling, cling; hark, the merry jingle;
                Cling, cling, cling, cling; swift it’s drawing nigh;
                How it makes my nerves with joy to tingle,
                What’s the reason why?
                Ancient and hoary though I be,
                My beard a cloud of gray,
                There is no other sport to me
                Like riding in a sleigh.

      _Chorus._ Ancient and hoary though he be
                His beard a cloud of gray,
                He says “There is no other sport to me
                Like riding in a sleigh.”

                Cling, cling, cling, cling: ring ye merry sleigh-bells,
                Cling, cling, cling, cling; on the frosty air.
                What tales of joy each little metal tongue tells,
                Joy without a care.
                Swift as swallows in their flight
                My eight fleet reindeers go,
                With stars above to furnish light
                Reflected by the snow.

_Repeat chorus softly as_ SANTA CLAUS _exits_ C., _followed by_ FOOTMAN
_and_ COACHMAN, _the rest gazing after him_.

                                CURTAIN.

                             END OF ACT I.




                                ACT II.


    _SCENE._—_Same as in Act I. Sleigh bells heard in distance
              coming nearer, until they stop at_ C.; SANTA CLAUS
             _enters_ C., _followed by_ GUSSIE _and preceded by_
              FOOTMAN.
                                                (_Exit_, FOOTMAN.

_Gus._ Your majesty has returned. You are even more prompt than usual.
No one would suspect that those venerable whiskers of yours had been
silvered by the frosts of many hundreds of winters.

_Santa._ No, Gus my boy, time has no power to dampen the ardor
of old Santa Claus, nor to make him the less able to perform his
self-appointed duties. But that reminds me Gus.; last night my daughter
made a strange request. You heard it did you not?

_Gus._ Yes, your majesty, I heard it, and thought it strange that you
should make the promise that you did.

_Santa._ And so it was, and would have been much worse than strange had
not a happy thought struck me with a force like unto a hod of falling
bricks.

_Gus._ In other words, you had an idea.

_Santa._ Right you are; and as a reward for your years of faithful
service I propose to share it with you.

_Gus._ (_aside_) I wish his idea would take the form of an increase in
my salary. Ten dollars a month scarce suffices to keep me in raiment
befitting my noble birth and high position, doncherno.

_Santa._ What were you saying, Gus?

_Gus._ I was saying, your majesty, that I would indeed be proud to
share your first idea with you.

_Santa._ Well then, this is the scheme: I have brought back with me a
man as green as the green isle from which he came, a regular Paddy of
the old school. My daughter, having seen no men but you and me, will
conclude that he is one of the choicest specimens of his species, and
will thus be disenchanted.

_Gus._ The scheme looks well upon the face of it; I only hope that it
may conclude even as your majesty wishes.

_Santa._ You hope that it may work! Why sir, it _must_ work! Think of
the position I would be in should my daughter ever marry! In six short
months or less, my son-in-law would have my throne and I would lose my
job; mayhaps, shorn of my kingly robes, be slinging hash to earn my
daily bread.

                                                       (_shudders_

_Gus._ Well now, that’s clevah, deucedly clevah, by Jove.

_Santa._ What is that? Clever, did you say?

_Gus._ I mean, your majesty, that it was very clevah of you to
extricate yourself from such a trying situation.

_Santa._ Oh! yes, that’s different; and now I will proceed to unfold my
plans to you.

_Gus._ Proceed by all means.

_Santa._ I have ordered the terrier to be brought into this room,
and have also requested that my daughter come here. We will conceal
ourselves and enjoy her astonishment at her first meeting with her man.

                  (O’ROURKE’S _voice heard off_ L.

_O’Rourke._ Can’t yez let go av me arrums, yez miserable dagos? Do yez
think Oi can’t walk alone at all, at all?

_Santa._ Ah! there he comes. Now then.

                                     (_they hide behind throne-chair_

commiseration Oi’ve created, to be share.

                          _Enter_, FOOTMAN, C.

Oh, get out av this, get out av this! You little spalpeen; can’t yez
lave me alone at all, at all.

_Foot._ I have answered the bell sir, what is your wish?

_O’Rourke._ (_aside_) Oh, Oi see, he has come to take my order.
(_aloud_) Oi say, send me up a ton of coal and a match; do yez moind?

_Foot._ We have no coal, sir.

_O’Rourke._ Will yez listen to that now! Yez have no coal, is it? Thin
phwat do yez do for a foire, say now?

_Foot._ We use no fire, sir; we do not feel the cold.

_O’Rourke._ Yez don’t feel the could? Well thin, Oi do just that same.

the daughter of Santa Claus.

_O’Rourke._ Was that him what tore me away from moi home and kindred
last noight?

_Kitty._ I suppose so.

_O’Rourke._ Then, Miss Claus, Oi shall have yer father prosecuted for
cruelty to animals. That’s phwat Oi will. (_motions_ KITTY _to come
nearer_) Come here, now, come here, come here. (KITTY _comes to his
side_, O’ROURKE _in a stage whisper says_) Do yez chew gum?

_Kitty._ No sir, my mamma says I mustn’t.

_O’Rourke._ Well now, that’s a good girrul. Here is a penny; go to the
blacksmith’s and get a bun. Say, do you play on the type-writer?

_Kitty._ Play on the type-writer?

_O’Rourke._ To be coorse.

                    (_goes through motions of writing with his fingers_

_Kitty._ What is that? I never saw a type-writer.

_O’Rourke._ Never saw a type-writer? Oh moi child, moi child, Oi fear
your musical eddication has been sadly neglected.

_Kitty._ I hope not, sir. I can sing quite well; at least so my papa
says. Shall I sing for you?

_O’Rourke._ Yis, sing to me.

_Kitty._ What shall I sing?

_O’Rourke._ Oh, Oi don’t, care; anything but “Marguerite.”

_Kitty._ Well then, how would you like to hear “The Song That Reached
My Heart?”

_O’Rourke._ Oh, don’t do that, don’t do that. Oi’ve got the toothache.

_Kitty._ You are hard to please, sir; but if you do not care to
hear the song that reached my heart, I will sing you one of my own
composition, written upon a theme which is nearest my heart, “The
Pleasure of Catching a Man.”

_Kitty sings_

         THE PLEASURE OF CATCHING A MAN.
     _Music, “McSarley’s Most Elegant Twins.”_

    I’ve a question momentous I wish to propound
    To matrons and maidens alike:
    If you lived in a land where men are not found,
    Don’t you think you would go on a strike?
    What’s the use of fine features, of bright eyes and curls,
    When no one is by to admire?
    I’ve tried it, and know what I’m saying, dear girls,
    Of that kind of life you’d soon tire.

    _Chorus._ In childhood it’s dollies, it’s novels for girls,
    But tell me my friends if you can,
    Where’s the pleasure in life for a girl of eighteen
    Like the pleasure of catching a man?

    Each day like the former a burden time hangs
    On your hands; life itself is a bore.
    With not even ambition to curl your bangs,
    And your mirrors with dust covered o’er,
    You would turn with disgust from a tailor-made gown,
    From diamonds, lace and all that,
    And in extreme cases one might even frown
    At a love or a duck of a hat.

    You have heard of the blossom whose sweetest perfume
    Was wasted upon desert air,
    But the aimless existence of this pretty bloom
    Does not for a moment compare
    With the life of a maiden, the victim of Fate,
    Compelled to live out life’s span
    In a country that does not provide her a mate,
    Too poor to furnish a man.

_O’Rourke._ That’s a foine song, to be sure; beautiful sentiment and
all that, but are you really in earnest about this matter?

_Kitty._ Indeed I am.

_O’Rourke._ Thin how would yez loike to become Mrs. O’Rourke?

_Kitty._ (_running toward him_) Oh! do you really mean—(_turning away_)
er—er—this is so sudden—you must give me time to think.

_O’Rourke._ “Think it over!” Yes, an’ whoile yez is thinkin’ it over
Oi’ll be sthandin’ here frazin’ to death. Yez’ll have to do yer
thinkin’ purty quick Miss Claus, or yez’ll be a widdy before yez is
married, so you will.

_Kitty._ Are you really cold, dear? Why of course you are; how stupid
of me to forget that you are not used to such a rigorous climate and
those clothes of yours are hardly the proper thing for this frigid
zone. I suppose you did not have time to change your clothes.

_O’Rourke._ To be coorse Oi didn’t have toime to get a shave even.
(_strokes whiskers_) Bad cess to that father of yours.

_Kitty._ Poor man, how you must suffer. Come with me. I will have the
court tailor take your measure for a suit of furs and the servants
shall see that you are provided with a fire.

_O’Rourke._ Kitty, yez is a good girrul; but Oi say, would yez moind
sinding up a ham and some hen-fruit.

_Kitty._ Hen-fruit?

_O’Rourke._ Yis, some eggs, you know.

_Kitty._ Oh! of course not. You shall have something to eat at once.

                                                    (KITTY _goes to_ C.

_O’Rourke._ (_aside_) McGinnis ould bye, yer in luck this toime to be
sure. What a pity it is we can’t all be borrun with silver spoons in
our pockets. Jist look at me now! Oi’m goin’ to have a shquare meal, a
shute of clothes and perhaps a woife, and whin Oi get her Oi’m goin’
right back to ould Erin and—(_stops to think_) Ah! there’s the rub. How
am Oi goin’ to get back to Erin? (_aloud_) Well Kitty, Oi’m with yez
whoile the grub lashts.

                                                          (_exeunt_, C.

          SANTA CLAUS _and_ GUSSIE _come from behind throne_.

_Gus._ Well now, that’s clevah, deucedly clevah!

_Santa._ Oh Gussie! Gussie! Would you add insult to injury by mocking a
poor old man whose only daughter is about to break her father’s heart
by becoming the wife of a potato-masher?

_Gus._ Pardon me, your majesty, but the potato-masher seems to have
crushed us very successfully. He has quite a fetching way with the
ladies too. I couldn’t have managed that little romance better myself.

_Santa._ But what is to be done to avert this dreadful calamity?

_Gus._ Send the terrier away, of course.

_Santa._ Impossible! The man would die of cold and hunger. You seem
to forget, Gussie, that we are surrounded with ice and snow, piled
mountain-high. How many brave explorers from the land of mortals have
lost their lives in the attempt to penetrate the mysteries of the North
Pole.

_Gus._ But can you not take the man away as you brought him here?

_Santa._ Have you also forgotten that one of the conditions of my
becoming immortal and the Christmas Saint was that I was not to leave
these icy fastnesses but once each year? I can not take this man away
until next year on Christmas Eve, in that time who knows what dreadful
things may happen?

                                                (_completely un-nerved_

_Gus._ Your majesty, give me leave to think.

_Santa._ Yes, Gussie, think! think! I know not if dudes have a thinker,
but if you have thinks to think, prepare to think them now Gussie,
prepare to think them now. (SANTA _drops in chair at table overcome by
emotion, while_ GUSSIE _walks up and down the room in comical attitude
of thinking_.) Your thinker seems to be working rather slowly, Gussie;
time is very precious to me now.

                           (GUSSIE _stops suddenly and claps his hands_

_Gus._ I have it!

_Santa._ Good! What is it?

_Gus._ It is a plan to circumvent this Hibernian rogue, a very simple
plan, but clever, deucedly clever and reflects great credit upon it’s
author.

_Santa._ Gussie, if your plan succeeds, I’ll raise your salary to
$12.00 a month.

_Gus._ I hear some one approaching. I will not have time to explain my
plan in detail, but you must promise to make no objection to any of my
actions while I am carrying the plan out, and I assure you all will be
right in the end.

           _Enter_, O’ROURKE, R. U. E.

_Santa._ (_hesitating_) I will do as you wish.

                                                  (_exit_, L.

  O’ROURKE _advances forward looking admiringly at himself
                     in a new suit of clothes_.

_O’Rourke._ Begorra, it’s a foine display Oi’m makin’ now. Oi’m a
worker from Cork so Oi am, and—(_sees_ GUSSIE) Oh! take it away, take
it away!

_Gus._ This is Mr. O’Rourke, I believe. I must take the liberty of
introducing myself. I am Gussie de Smythe, Grand Illustrious Scribe and
Supreme Confidential Clerk to his Majesty, Santa Claus, Ruler of the
Kingdom of the North Pole.

_O’Rourke._ (_aside_) He looks like a grand illustrated squib from
“Puck.” (_aloud_) Oi say, could you say that again and say it real
slow? You ought to be more careful about makin’ payple acquainted wid
doubtful characters. Howsomever, Oi don’t moind a little thing loike
that in a could counthry loike this. Oi’m quite fond of curiosities
moiself, so Oi am.

_Gus._ Sir, this unseemly levity is far from being as clevah as you
suppose, in fact it is quite the contrary, doncherno; but to proceed to
business—you know the purpose for which you were brought here, do you
not?

_O’Rourke._ Well thin, Oi don’t jist that same; Oi don’t know nawthin’
about it at all, at all an’ that’s phwat’s the matter with me, so it is.

_Gus._ Then I can enlighten you upon that point. You were brought here
to ascend the throne and become the successor of Santa Claus as ruler
of the Kingdom of the North Pole.

_O’Rourke._ You don’t say; an’ how much will Oi git fur that job now?

_Gus._ Oh! you will have this beautiful palace, innumerable servants
and countless wealth at your disposal.

_O’Rourke._ But how about the wurruk? Phwat’s moy hours?

_Gus._ You will have no work to do, nothing to do but sit on your
throne and make laws for the government of your Kingdom. A monarch
is never supposed to do anything for himself; there will be hosts of
servants at hand to do your bidding; and I, as your private secretary,
will ever be at your side ready to carry out your desires as soon, or
even before, they are expressed.

_O’Rourke._ All roight, Oi’ll go you wan for luck. Begorra this job is
ace and joker ahead of the perlice force.

_Gus._ I am glad that you are willing to assume the responsibilities
of the office sir. No time need be lost; we will proceed with the
coronation ceremonies at once.

                                    (_pulls bell-rope: noise as before_

_O’Rourke._ The corneration ceremonies? An’ phwat might them same be
now?

_Gus._ You shall soon see. I have summoned all of the royal household,
including Santa Claus himself; he will renounce his title and the
throne, and will publicly proclaim you king with the title of Santa
Claus the II.

    O’ROURKE _struts up and down the stage arranging his
        collar and tie_. SANTA CLAUS _enters_ L. U. E.,
       _with_ MRS. CLAUS _and_ KITTY _on either arm; comes
        down stage_ L., _followed by the_ HOLIDAYS; FAIRIES
       _enter_ R. U. E.; FOOTMAN _and_ COACHMAN _enter_ C.,
       _and stand on each side of the door_.

_O’Rourke._ Ah! there’s Kitty. Swate girrul, that Kitty. Oi say, Kitty,
ain’t Oi a darlint in my new suit of clothes?

_Kitty._ You are indeed a charming creature, Mr. O’Rourke. Are you for
sale?

_O’Rourke._ Oi don’t know. Oi’ll come hoigh if Oi am. Oi’m the only wan
av me that’s left.

GUSSIE _takes position in front, clears his throat and makes a few
preliminary gestures as if preparing to make a speech_.

_Gus._ Friends, Romans, Countrymen—

_O’Rourke._ Naw you don’t! Naw you don’t! You don’t borry anything from
me at all, at all.

_Gus._ (_ignoring the interruption_) I have summoned you here to
witness the coronation ceremonies of Mr. McGinnis O’Rourke, whom I now
proclaim King of the North Pole with the title of Santa Claus II.

_Santa._ (_going over to_ GUSSIE _and speaking angrily_) What
are you saying, sir? This is treason! Do you hear? Treason!

               (GUSSIE _goes through pantomime of explaining to_ SANTA

_O’Rourke._ Do yez hear that now? Oi’m going to be King, so Oi am; and
Kitty, you shall be moy bride and do me washin’. You’re a princess now
Oi belave, but Oi’m going to make yez a rale queen. Do yez hear, Kitty
moy darlint? A rale queen and you shall have a new piece of gum ivery
day, so you shall.

_Mrs. C._ What is that dreadful man saying? Come Kitty my child, you
must not stay here to be insulted in this way.

                                         (_tries to lead_ KITTY _off_ R.

_Santa._ (_speaking aloud as he returns to his wife’s side_) All right,
Gussie, my boy; but be careful, be very careful.

                         (_pantomime of persuading his wife to remain_

_Gus._ Well, Mr. O’Rourke, are you prepared to take the coronation oath?

_O’Rourke._ No sir! Oi niver shware. Oi’m not abducted to the use av
profanity in any forrum sir.

_Gus._ Well, I suppose the taking of the oath would be a useless
formality in your case; we will dispense with it. (_to_ FOOTMAN _and_
COACHMAN) Bring in the royal diadem to crown his gracious majesty and
the royal sceptre, the symbol of his power.

           FOOTMAN _and_ COACHMAN _exit_ C., _and return with
                  a large crown and a feather duster_.

_Gus._ Your majesty, in investing you with these symbols of royalty I
feel that I am conferring an unique distinction upon this people by
giving them for a ruler a man the like of whom has never before escaped
captivity.

_Omnes._ Hear! Hear!

    FOOTMAN _places crown on_ O’ROURKE’S _head, he having
       been led to the throne and seated thereon by_
       GUSSIE, _who takes feather duster from_ COACHMAN
       _and brushes it across_ O’ROURKE’S _face_.
       O’ROURKE _sneezes and fumbles in his pocket for a
       handkerchief_. GUSSIE _takes it from him and wipes
       his nose for him_. FOOTMAN _and_ COACHMAN _retire
       to_ C.

_O’Rourke._ Begorra, Oi’ve a notion to swipe yez for that, so Oi have.

_Gus._ Pardon me, your majesty, but it is one of the privileges of my
exalted office to perform all little services of that kind for our
king. As I told you, a monarch is never permitted to do anything for
himself. There yet remains the Coronation song.

                       CORONATION SONG.
            _To the tune of “This House is Haunted.”_

    _Gus._ I now proclaim you our king, our monarch,
           And we your vassals true will be;
           Be gracious to us, do not refuse us,
           Thou brightest gem of royalty.

    _Mrs. C._ O! never fear, Gus., he’ll not refuse us,
              How could you look for that from such as he?

    _Gus. and Mrs. C._ He’s much too greedy and likewise seedy
                       From such a snap as this to flee.

    _Chorus._ We now proclaim you our king, our monarch
              And we your vassals true will be,
              Be gracious to us, do not refuse us,
              Thou brightest gem of royalty.

    _Kitty._ We have a man now lately imported
             From over the sea, the Emerald Isle;
             We must not lose him, I will amuse him,
             Each idle moment I’ll be beguile.

    _Santa._ Oh never fear, dear, he will remain here,
             He will not haste to leave us yet a while.

    _Kitty and Santa._ But if he would go, he could not do so,
                       Becoming an iceberg is not quite his style.

                              (O’ROURKE _falls asleep during the song_

_Santa._ Well I declare, the fellow has actually fallen asleep!

                                            (_exit_, FAIRIES, R. U. E.

_O’Rourke._ (_starting suddenly_) No Oi’m not asleep naythur. Who said
Oi was asleep, eh? (_yawns; starts to raise his hand to his mouth_;
GUSSIE _places his own hand over_ O’ROURKE’S _mouth_) By the powers
now, Oi’ve a notion to knock a quart of stars out av yez eyes for that.

                                                           (_sparring_

_Gus._ Your majesty, it is one of the privileges of my office to cover
the King’s mouth when he yawns.

_O’Rourke._ It is, is it? Well don’t yez do that same any more while Oi
am King or Oi’ll have yez hanged by the neck until yez are asphixiated,
see?

_Kitty._ Poor man! It is very tiresome work, being a King.

_O’Rourke._ It is just that Miss Kitty; let me advise yez not to try
it. But it will be different when Oi have you for my queen.

_Santa._ That can never be!

_O’Rourke._ Phwat is that? Git out sir, git out! Oi’ll have you
banished to wance.

       (GUSSIE _goes through pantomime imploring_ SANTA _to be silent_

_Gus._ Would your majesty be pleased to review the Amazons, the
defenders of our realm?

_O’Rourke._ Oi don’t know what an Amazon is, but Oi’ll be glad to
interview anything for a change.

    _Enter_, FAIRIES _and_ HOLIDAYS, _and execute a fancy march_.

    _During progress of march_ O’ROURKE _attempts to
       applaud and take part in, in all of which attempts
       he is prevented by_ GUSSIE, _who explains in
       pantomime that it does not become a monarch to
       do anything of these things. At close of march_,
       AMAZONS _take positions on_ R. _and_ L. _of stage_.

O’ROURKE. Well now girruls, that’s foine. Oi think Oi’ll have yez on
guard duty around the throne all the time. Oi’m afraid somebody’ll
stale me, so Oi am. (_to_ GUSSIE, _who is talking to_ KITTY) Here sir,
come away from that! Get me something to eat. Oi hanker for poy.

_Gus._ Your majesty shall have pie in one minute.

                                                     (_talks to_ KITTY

_O’Rourke._ (_astounded_) In wan minute! Ye haythen. Oi am the King and
when Oi want poy Oi want poy, and begorra Oi’m going to have it too.

                  O’ROURKE _starts toward_ C., GUSSIE
 _takes him by the arm and leads him back to throne, and makes sign to_
                        FOOTMAN _who exits_, C.

GUS. Your majesty shall have pie; but this unseemly haste ill befits a
monarch.

          _Enter_, FOOTMAN, C., _with pie on plate_.

_O’Rourke._ Ah! that’s a sight to gladden moy eyes, so it is. Bring the
noble birrud here.

    O’ROURKE _starts to leave throne_; FOOTMAN _kneels and
       presents pie_; GUSSIE _takes it from him and eats it
       to the consternation of_ O’ROURKE.

_Gus._ (_with mouth full of pie_) Your majesty, it is one of the
privileges of my exalted office to eat the King’s pie for him,
doncherno?

  (O’ROURKE _grows very angry; leaves the throne and comes down stage_

_O’Rourke._ This is the last ton av coal that broke the camel’s back!
Oi have let yez blow moy nose for me, scratch moy head for me and lead
me around loike a poodle on the end of a shtring, but Oi will let no
cigarette sign av yure soize eat moy poy for me sir! No sir! Not for
Venice! Yez can take yer ould kingdom; it’s nawthin but an Oice-house
anyway. Oi shall go back to Cork, get on the perlice force and eat a
poy-factory ivery day if Oi want to. That’s phwat Oi’ll do.

_Santa._ (_aside to_ GUSSIE) Gussie you’re a jewel of the
first water. I congratulate you upon the success of your scheme.

_O’Rourke._ Kitty, will yez fly wid me?

_Kitty._ Unfortunately sir, I cannot fly, though I wish I could, for
that seems to be the only way by which we can escape this icy prison.

_Santa._ (_to_ GUSSIE) Sir, I denounce you! Your scheme is a
failure. My daughter’s mind remains unchanged. She is ready, even now,
to fly to the end of the earth with this Hibernian babboon!

_Gus._ Your majesty I have done my best; what more could I do. It was a
noble plan and worthy the great brain from which it sprang, but success
and failures are not far distant and I have fallen just outside the
foul-line.

_O’Rourke._ Yez is a quare birrud, Mr. Gus.

_Santa._ Yez, you have failed. And failed in such a way that the
dread calamity which you have endeavored to avert is now nearer than
before. What shall I do? What _shall_ I do? Ah, that is the question;
whether it were better to wed my daughter to this billy-goat and set at
rest, at once, this most vexatious question, or look me further for a
son-in-law. Ah! ha! I have a scheme! I’ll ask this man some questions
in the presence of my vassals here. An examination I’ll conduct more
strict than ever Civil Service knew. (_to_ O’ROURKE) Here sir,
I would a word with you.

_O’Rourke._ All roight sor, apake out. Don’t be timid in the presence
av royalty.

_Santa._ As the father of the girl, whose hand you seek in marriage, I
claim the privilege of inquiring concerning your antecedents.

_O’Rourke._ Av coorse, av coorse.

_Santa._ Who was your great-grandfather?

_O’Rourke._ A man sor, and an Oirishman at that. He could foight sor
loike a dog and drink the craythure loike a fish dhrinking wather. And
such a jolly man he was too at a wake. Oi often wonder that the corpse
itself didn’t come to loife to take a hand in the fistivities.

_Santa._ Your future prespect, sir, what are they? I mean—what shekels
are at your command.

_O’Rourke._ A dollar and twenty kopecks is all Oi have at prisint, sor,
but Oi have a political pull that can be cashed at a moment’s notice.

_Santa._ Your health is good of course; your digestion unimpaired?

_O’Rourke._ And was yez spaking of moy digestion now? Begorra, jist
connect me wid a shquare meal and Oi’ll show yez phwat Oi can do in
that same line, so Oi will.

_Santa._ Such a foolish act as that would only serve to bankrupt our
kingdom. But one more question I would ask; dost ever gamble, drink or
smoke?

_O’Rourke._ Naythur av the former sor, but on accasions whin Oi would
be quite shwell Oi shmoke a cigarette or two.

_Santa._ Ah, fiend! Away with him!

_Omnes._ Shameful, shameful! A crime deserving death!

                              (AMAZONS _form a circle around_ O’ROURKE

_Mrs. C._ (_to_ KITTY) My daughter, see what a fate thy rash
infatuation would have consigned thee to.

_Kitty._ I’ll save him yet and reform him. That is the mission of a
pretty girl; to make at least one man better.

    _While_ KITTY _is speaking Tableau curtain at back opens and_
         ERIN, _the_ GODDESS _of Ireland, appears. She steps
          majestically to_ C. _of stage_.

_Erin._ O’Rourke, thou’rt found at last,
        I’ve searched for thee both far and wide
        For many hours past.
        Why from thine own native land
        To this place didst thou roam?
        Come sir, come hence with me,
        I fain would see thee home.

_O’Rourke._ Yes, Oi want to go home, Oi want to go home; take me
home—(_stops suddenly_) But what about Kitty?

_Erin._ Kitty? What hast thou to do with the child?

_O’Rourke._ She is going to be moy woife, ain’t you KITTY, me darlint?
Oi was going to make her moy queen, but Oi couldn’t even make a queen
of moyself now.

_Erin._ Think of the maids of thy native isle,

        Return at once and there we’ll find
               A fairer bride for thee.
        With eyes so bright and skin so fair,

        And Kitty isn’t in it.

_Gus._ Well now, that’s clevah, deucedly clevah, doncherno I believe I

_Mrs. C._ Kitty, you must not go. Think of your parents left

_Gus._ Oh! I say now, that’s clevah, deucedly clevah. I am agreeable
and leave the matter entirely with Miss Kitty, doncherno.

_Kitty._ Bah! A dude lacks five points of being equal to no husband.
I’ll marry a _man_ or never wed. (_sadly_) Shall I go or stay? I can

       toward_ KITTY, _who moves slowly toward him and extends
       both her hands, one of which_ O’ROURKE _takes_. MRS.

M. Adolphe Trimadart, who on a visit to London saves the life of M.
Dupraillon at a fire, for which Dupraillon is very grateful and takes
Adolphe to his home in Paris—Adolphe falls in love with a young lady
at a glove store unknown to Dupraillon—During Mrs. Dupraillon’s
absence from the city Dupraillon accidently meets a lady—a supper at
Clerbois’—an accident as he leaves the house causes him to stumble
against some gentlemen whose hats are knocked off; during the scuffle
the cry of “police” is heard, and he picks up, as he supposes, his
own hat, but on arriving at home he discovers he has a hat with M.
Durand’s card, while his hat has his own card in—His wife returns and
he is afraid she will discover his adventure and supper at Clerbois’
with the lady. The three hats cause a great deal of trouble as well
as amusement, as the owners, as well as others, get mixed up in the
misunderstanding caused by the exchanging of hats.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
